// When low + high is calculated directly, thereâ€™s a potential risk of overflow if both low and high are large numbers.
// By using low + (high - low) / 2, we avoid adding two potentially large numbers directly. Instead, we first subtract low from high (which is safe because high is greater or equal to low), and then divide the difference by 2 before adding it to low.
