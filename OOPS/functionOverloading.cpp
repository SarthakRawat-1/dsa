// When two or more functions in the same scope share the same name but have different parameters, itâ€™s called function overloading.
// It is compile time polymorphism, because when we compile the code, the compiler will decide which Overloaded function to call based on the parameters passed.

#include <iostream>

class Area {
    public :

    // Returns area of a circle
    int calculateArea(int r) {

    }
    // Now remember that you can't again make a function here with calculateArea name which has only one int as it's parameter, even if you cahnge the name like, int s. There should be difference of either datatypes and/or number of arguments. 

    // Returns area of rectangle

int main() {
