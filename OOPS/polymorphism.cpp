// Polymorphism provides the ability to call the same function on different objects, and each object can respond in its own way. 
// The word polymorphism means "many forms." In C++, polymorphism is achieved primarily through two mechanisms :- Compile-time polymorphism (Static polymorphism) and Run-time polymorphism (Dynamic polymorphism)

// Compile-Time Polymorphism (Static Polymorphism) is resolved during the compile time. It is mainly achieved through :- Function Overloading, Operator Overloading and Templates
// Run-time polymorphism is achieved using inheritance and virtual functions. This allows C++ to decide which function to invoke at runtime rather than at compile time. The main mechanism for achieving run-time polymorphism is method overriding.
